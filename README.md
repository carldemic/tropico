**LLM Honeypot**

**Paramiko-based custom SSH server running inside Docker, simulating a real login shell environment in LLM mode or real mode.**

---

## üöÄ Features:

- Python SSH server using **Paramiko**.
- **LLM-Backed Fake Terminal Mode (Default Mode):**
  - Commands are passed to an OpenAI-compatible LLM API (e.g., GPT models).
  - **Per-session memory:** Commands and their outputs are remembered during each SSH session (e.g., `mkdir` persists across `ls` commands).
  - **Realistic prompt and environment.**
- **Real Bash login shell mode:**
  - Loads `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, environment variables, aliases, virtualenv, etc.
- SSH server listens on **port 22 inside Docker**, mapped to **port 2222 on host**.
- Default user credentials:
  - **Username:** `admin`
  - **Password:** `password`

---

## üîë Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```
# OpenAI API key for LLM Mode
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key

# Select model (e.g., gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4-turbo, etc.)
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo

# Default user & host info (affects prompt)
DEFAULT_USER=admin
DEFAULT_HOSTNAME=virtual-machine
USER_PASSWORD=password
```

---

## üê≥ Usage:

### 1. **Build and run Docker Compose image and service:**

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

Or use the included `run.sh` script.

---

### 2. **SSH into the server:**

```bash
ssh admin@127.0.0.1 -p 2222
```
Default password: `password`.

Port is set by default on 2222, you can change it in `docker-compose.yml`.

---

### 3. **Shut down the server:**

```bash
docker compose down
```

Or use the included `stop.sh` script.


## üåê HTTPS Fake Server (LLM-powered)

In addition to the SSH honeypot, this project includes a **fake HTTPS server powered by an LLM model**, designed to behave like a valid HTTPS server when accessed via browsers or curl clients.

---

### üöÄ Features:

- **Valid HTTPS server behavior:**
  - Uses a TLS certificate (self-signed by default) to perform proper TLS handshake.
  - Listens on **port 443**.
  - Responds with correct HTTP/1.1 headers.

- **Dynamic LLM-based HTML content:**
  - Each HTTP request triggers an OpenAI-compatible LLM to generate realistic HTML content.
  - Simulates a real website serving valid HTML pages.

- **Compatible with browsers and curl:**
  - Appears like a real HTTPS server when accessed.
  - No visible signs of being simulated.

---

### üîë Environment Variables:

The HTTPS server uses the same `.env` configuration as the SSH service:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo
```

---

### üê≥ Usage:

**Start both SSH and HTTPS services together:**

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

---

### üåê Access:

Visit the following URL (port is set by default on 8443, you can change it in `docker-compose.yml`):

```
https://localhost:8443
```

Or:

```bash
curl -k https://localhost:8443
```

---

### üõ† Certificates:

- By default, the HTTPS server uses a **self-signed TLS certificate** (`certs/cert.pem` & `certs/key.pem`). Using a self-signed certificate won't work most of the time though. You can change the certificate names in the environment variables, but they should stay in the `certs` path.
```bash
TLS_CERT_FILE=certs/cert.pem
TLS_CERT_KEY=certs/key.pem
```


- You can generate self-signed certificates with this command:
```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes -subj "/CN=localhost"
```

- Alternatively, you can replace these files with your own certificates (e.g., using [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) if on localhost; otherwise use CA generated certificates) to avoid browser trust warnings.


### Throttling

- By setting `MAX_REQUESTS_PER_IP` you can limit the number of requests per IP. After that limit, the client will receive a `404` error in HTTPS and a `Command not found` in SSH.

### Logging

- Logs are saved by default in the `logs` directory, one per service. They are automatically capped to `LOG_MAX_SIZE_MB` size (in MB) and GZip rotated up to a maximum of `LOG_BACKUP_COUNT` archived files.
